            <p>Welcome.</p>
            <p>
                These are few assignments you can try while you are learning web development. We have
                been learning theory since quite some time now and I think theory is good, it gets your
                foundation correct, but after some time practical knowledge is must. It's a totally
                different kind of fun when you see concepts in action and that's why I have decided to
                create this website.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are two functions of this website. One of them is to obviously teach you to code,
                but second one is to make it interactive and show you how real life stories are actually
                made of small concept. Not one, not two, but a lot of them working together.
            </p>

            <p>
                While you go through these pages, I want you to go through the source code of each and every
                page. How do you do that? Right click on the page and click on 'View page source'. And don't
                just read the code, study it. Study each and every single thing in it; and to help you do that,
                I have added many comments.
            </p>

            <p>
                That's it for now! <a href="01.html">Let's get started!!</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                Good luck,<br>
